          <p><img src="https://quasilabs.in/blog/res/stonehenge.jpeg" alt="High Performance Teams"></p>
<p>We did a lot of things right in the early days of <strong>Cleartrip</strong>, albeit, serendipitously. The team that was forged in the fires of hashtag#startup mountain was something magical.</p>
<p>We had the honour of hearing <strong>John Doerr</strong> himself speak in our Mahalaxmi office. I clearly remember his advice:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Hire only A people. A people hire A/A+ people. B people hire C people&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Hire missionaries not mercenaries&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>We hired the crazies. The curious. The deeply interested. People who were willing to take the leap of faith. People who believed.</p>
<p><em><strong>The missionaries</strong></em></p>
<p>Leave the HR out of this - they are not designed to hire a startup tech team.</p>
<p>Startup teams are built on <em><strong>mutual trust</strong></em>. Everyone must feel comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, discussing mistakes, and showing vulnerability without fear. They must be able to freely challenge each other to do better.</p>
<p>Only in such an environment can they give their true best. In a manner early startup teams are software commandos.</p>
<p>An <em><strong>open forum</strong></em>. We debated and debated problems and challenges. We questioned everything.</p>
<p>This helped the team to rapidly evolve and mature. The team grew close, worked cohesively and supported each other.</p>
<p>We were all <em><strong>collectively</strong></em> responsible for outcomes.</p>
<p>We acknowledged contributions and celebrated achievements.</p>
<p>Optimize for the team. Do not overly celebrate or reward individuals.</p>
<p>Give autonomy. Ask for accountability in return.</p>
<p>Spend large efforts on mentoring. We all need to learn. Give time to learn.</p>
<p>Dont introduce enterprise process or add unnecessary red tape.</p>
<p>Georges Harik - an early Google employee - once visited us. When our Product team asked what tools they used for project management he simply replied: &ldquo;post-it notes&rdquo;. These were the early days at Google but a lot of exciting products like Orkut, Gmail were being developed.</p>
<p><strong>The shorter and faster the feedback loop the better</strong></p>
<p>Small autonomous teams of 3-4 <em>&ldquo;pizza teams&rdquo;</em> work best to solve focused problems.</p>
<p>To go the distance the team needs a <em><strong>clear</strong></em> vision and mission.</p>
<p>For us Hrush Bhatt, Stuart and Sandeep Murthy were always accessible. They spent a lot of time with us - we were <em><strong>all</strong></em> a team. Hrush, especially, was our mentor and leader and was always in the trenches with us.</p>
<p>Leadership matters. Critically. Dont hide in the cabin or behind big words. Roll up those sleeves and dig with the team.</p>
<p>A lot is changing around us. New tools. New capabilities. In all this chaos, the ones <em><strong>who will win,  who will succeed</strong></em> in the long term, will be the ones with the strongest teams.</p>
