      <description>&lt;p&gt;My grandfather left rural North Karnataka and moved to Mumbai in the 1950s. He had a large family, no place to stay, no job, and no particular skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, he was imaginative and skilled with his hands. He received an order to create a large 3D model of a bee from the government apiary in Bengaluru. He went to the public library, made hundreds of drawings of bees, and was able to craft a marvelous model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People have asked me why I chose to program in Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-days&#34;&gt;Early days&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long back (1995-6) when I was still a college student (studying Math) I first saw Prolog. Chirs Martis, then boyfriend (now husband) of my friend Medha Patkar used to work for some company in SEEPZ and he was working on a project for some Japanese company. They had to migrate an older code base to a newer stack. I disremember the details (I dont think I knew much anyway) but he was learning Prolog as they were using a translater written in Prolog to help in the translation of the older codebase. I was a curious cuss then, and kept pestering him with questions. I was interested and wanted to learn Prolog. This was before we had access to the Internet. So my friend Anuprita took me to the British Council Library where she was a member. I saw a couple of Prolog books - pretty hard for me to understand as I had scant background in Programming (I did not even own a computer at that time). But I also saw a tiny booklet about another language called Lisp written by some Indian author. What intrigued me was the factorial program on the last page - this did not look like any program I had ever seen. I was more interested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
