      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;teaching-claude-code-to-remember-building-session-memory-that-actually-works&#34;&gt;Teaching Claude Code to Remember: Building Session Memory That Actually Works&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Claude Code has become a legitimate part of my workflow. It&amp;rsquo;s changed how I approach certain tasks—exploratory work, documentation, even debugging. But it has a maddening limitation: it forgets. Context compaction kicks in, the conversation gets summarized, and suddenly we&amp;rsquo;re back to square one. Close the terminal? Complete amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t just an inconvenience. It breaks the entire collaboration model. Real work happens across sessions. You dig into a problem, make progress, hit a wall, sleep on it, come back fresh. That&amp;rsquo;s how humans work. If your AI pair programmer can&amp;rsquo;t maintain continuity, you spend half your time re-explaining context instead of solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://quasilabs.in/blog/res/throw-code.png&#34; alt=&#34;Throw Code&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many young teams, in their excitement to build stuff, end up spending time on things which are not directly progressing their product or service. I have been guilty of this myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often this stems from attempts at first principles thinking (which is great in principle) or Not-Invented-Here syndrome (not so good) coupled with a lack of research on existing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There has to be a clear advantage - a demonstrable positive ROI - to inventing a better wheel or for coming up with a custom solution. This is especially true of custom micro frameworks for routine things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://quasilabs.in/blog/res/stonehenge.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;High Performance Teams&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We did a lot of things right in the early days of &lt;strong&gt;Cleartrip&lt;/strong&gt;, albeit, serendipitously. The team that was forged in the fires of hashtag#startup mountain was something magical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had the honour of hearing &lt;strong&gt;John Doerr&lt;/strong&gt; himself speak in our Mahalaxmi office. I clearly remember his advice:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hire only A people. A people hire A/A+ people. B people hire C people&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hire missionaries not mercenaries&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We hired the crazies. The curious. The deeply interested. People who were willing to take the leap of faith. People who believed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tech Debt and Startups</title>
      <link>https://quasilabs.in/blog/2025/05/05/tech-debt-and-startups/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Startups are tough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are crazy pressures for speedy development and user acquisition. The roadmap moves all over the place. Life is full of passionate debates, coffee and late night debugging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These circumstances are prime breeding ground of a dangerous enemy -&#xA;TTDM, &lt;em&gt;The Technical Debt Monster (tm)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the race for the MVP you take shortcuts. You use sub-optimal but ready-made solutions. You have no time for thinking about abstractions. It just needs to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
