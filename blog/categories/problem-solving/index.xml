      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the books, which Alok Tiwari, a friend of mine from the old time, had suggested I read was &amp;lsquo;How to Solve it&amp;rsquo; by G Polya. I remember being enthralled reading it. It, with Euclid&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Elements&amp;rsquo;, are the two books which have had the most impact on my method of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I made a quick set of slides for sharing the salient points of that book with a few friends. The book itself is written in 1945 but still is a very inspiring read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
